# Work-Day-Scheduler

In this project, I create a scheduler that helps plan out activities for the day.
Not only is the time and date displayed, information can also be stored in each of the time blocks.

Upon page refresh, the information in each time block does not disappear. As time passes throughout the day, each time block will change its background color to mark if it is in the past, present, or future. The time block color will be grey (if in the past), red (if displaying time in the current hour), or green (if the time has yet to arrive at that time block). After the last time block has expired, the colors will automatically reset to white and will change color accordingly again the next day.
